This is a collection of OpenBSD ports for older MariaDB versions.
These ports install into versioned directories so you can run
multiple server versions at the same time for testing.

You can clone this repository and move it to
/usr/ports/mystuff/databases/mariadb-current
then you should be able to build these ports. (mariadb-current
is used as originally these ports were newer than the versions
supported in OpenBSD).

For simplicity, these ports do not use multi-packages, they
install both the client and server parts in one package. Also,
they do not include the mariadb-test directory, since that
bloats the package by quite a bit.

The 10.0 and 10.1 ports requires
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/mariadb-10.{0,1}/lib
for certain binaries to work, but newer MariaDB versions do not
appear to have the issue.
