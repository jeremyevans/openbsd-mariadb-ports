This is a collection of ports for mariadb versions after
the version in the OpenBSD ports tree. These ports install
into versioned directories so you can run multiple server
versions at the same time for testing.

You can clone this repository and move it to
/usr/ports/mystuff/databases/mariadb-current
then you should be able to build these ports.

For simplicity, these ports do not use multi-packages, they
install both the client and server parts in one package. Also,
they do not include the mariadb-test directory, since that
bloats the package by quite a bit.

The 10.1 port requires LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/mariadb-10.1/lib
for certain binaries to work, but newer MariaDB versions do not
appear to have the issue.
